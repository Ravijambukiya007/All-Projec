                <summary>What are coupons</summary>
                Coupons are a popular way for consumers to save money on their purchases. They offer discounts on a wide
                range of products, from groceries and household items to clothing and electronics.
                <br>
                They come in various forms, including paper coupons, digital coupons, and promo codes. These coupons can
                be
                found in newspapers, magazines, online, and in-store.

                <br>


                <b> How do Coupons Work?</b>
                <br>

                <p> Coupons work by providing customers with a discount on the purchase price of a product or service.
                    The
                    discount amount can be a percentage of the total cost or a specific dollar amount. For example, a
                    coupon
                    might offer 20% off a purchase or $10 off a $50 purchase. The discount is typically applied at the
                    time
                    of
                    checkout, either in-store or online.
                </p>

                Tips for Using Coupons
                <br>
                Look for coupons before you shop. You can find coupons in newspapers, magazines, online, and in-store.
                Look
                for coupons for the products you need before you head to the store.
                Check the expiration date. Coupons have an expiration date, so make sure you use them before they
                expire.
                This is especially important for digital coupons, which often have shorter expiration dates than paper
                coupons.
                Use coupons with sales. You can maximize your savings by using coupons when products are on sale. This
                can
                help you save even more money on your purchases.
                Understand coupon policies. Each store has its own coupon policy, so make sure you understand the rules
                before you try to use a coupon. Some stores may limit the number of coupons you can use, or have other
                restrictions.
                Don't buy something just because you have a coupon. While coupons can help you save money, they can also
                tempt you to buy things you don't need. Make sure you only use coupons for products you would purchase
                anyway.
                Overall, coupons are a great way to save money on your purchases. They come in various forms and can be
                found in newspapers, magazines, online, and in-store. When using coupons, make sure to look for them
                before
                you shop, check the expiration date, use them with sales, understand coupon policies, and only use them
                for
                products you would purchase anyway. With these tips, you can make the most of your coupons and save
                money on
                the products you need.
